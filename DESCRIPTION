Description: Localize rearrangements (i.e., disturbances in marker order) along 
    a focal genome relative to a compared genome, and classify them as 
    inversions, interchromosomal or intrachromosomal translocations. The 
    compared genome can be an ancestral genome reconstruction or an extant 
    genome. Rearrangements, breakpoints, and synteny blocks are output 
    in a tabular format and can be visualized by two graphical functions along 
    the focal genome, or be utilized for further custom analyses.
